# Classification model using logistic regression

In this notebook, we are going to work with diabetes data set. 
First part focusses on development of a Logistic Regression model on the diabetes data set to identify if a patient has diabetes.  
Second part focusses on development of Logistic Regression models on the diabetes data set by performing a stepwise addition of the features. Identify which features are informative towards the classification and choose the best model.
Third part focusses on FDR ('False Significance')and checks if it has impact on any of the above created models.
